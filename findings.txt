Summarise your findings here (see specification).
Sudoku becomes more difficult when many cells have multiple potential
values, leading to a higher branching factor and extensive
backtracking. Therefore, the number of recursive calls can serve as a proxy for the
complexity of different mystery boards. Mystery Two returned false,
indicating it is impossible to solve. Mystery One required over 400,000
recursive calls, while Mystery Three needed approximately 14,000 calls. The
significant number of calls for Mystery One suggests that it
encountered several local optima, necessitating deep exploration and
extensive backtracking. Consequently, one can deduce that Mystery One
is 'extremely hard', whereas Mystery Three is merely 'hard'. However,
it should be noted that the initial board configuration may skew the
difficulty of the board, because of the algorithm's sequential
approach; configurations with many empty or ambiguous squares in
the intial rows could lead to more recursive calls due to extensive
exploration and backtracking.
